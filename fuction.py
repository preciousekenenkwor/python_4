#Write a function that takes two arguments 
#that are integers and returns the sum of the integer 
# def eso(x,y):
#     sum = x+y
#     print(sum)
#     return sum
# eso(2 ,4)

#Using what we've learned on list 
#methods and dictionary methods explain 
#how you will create a function that takes 
#dictionary as an argument and the function will
#return just the list of the keys in that dictionary. 
#Code example will be a plus

# book = {'name':'derek', 'tribe':'delta', 'school':'benin'}

# def esos(book):
#   bn = dict(book).keys()
#   return 


#Using a list of integers create a 
#loop that prints the integer in 
#he array. Please note there is 
#nothing like total=0 in this question. 

# best = [4, 7, 8, 9, 5,6]
# for i in best:
#   print(i)

#write a python fuctions to find the sum of all 
#elements in a list

# def eso(lis):
#   total = 0
#   for i in lis:
#     total +=i
#   print(total)



# eso(     [2,4, 4,5,7,8]       )



# ~#write a function that takes a name argument and returns welcome onbarad plu sthe persons name
